Preparation for meeting:
This week I finished the domino proof we worked on.
I also started reading Meta-Programming in Lean 4, and started writing down my
thoughts and some notes in `metaprogramming.md`, and wrote a little code in
`sandbox/Meta.lean`
I also wanted to show Shachar FStar, and how the SMT solver makes typechecking
much easier.

> Having a macro that unifies types via an SMT solver could be very handy.
